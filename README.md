## Introduction

This repository is the official MATLAB implementation of the Fast Automatic Deconvolution (FAD) method for Macro X-ray Fluorescence (MA-XRF) data collected from easel paintings. Details of the FAD method can be found in "A fast automatic method for deconvoluting macro X-ray fluorescence data collected from easel paintings," IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, vol. 9, pp. 649-664, 2023. Paper links: [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17496) and [published version](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158498).



This work was in part of the EPSRC-funded ARTICT "Art Through the ICT Lens: Big Data Processing Tools to Support the Technical Study, Preservation and Conservation of Old Master Paintings" project (EP/R032785/1).
